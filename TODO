TODO
  - code cleanup
    * cleanup the mixer/sound/mod_player/sfx_player mess
    * cleanup Collision / ZOrdering / PiegeGroups stuff
  - improve music/sound quality
  - move all the static data to an external file (maybe)
  - handle .seq files (displayed in 'overlay' mode, like the 3DO version does) (maybe)
